# how is LLMs able to do in context learning. Does timing matter to test on a samples_per_eval




# does it make a differencd if I test on a prompt at different time (F1 not stable) - how to signal stable F1 score

run many times to get mean standard error, smaller test, larger varirance  

We repeat our experiments five times with different
random seeds to report the mean and standard deviation



# what does the highest weight in the proposal distribution mean and how it relates to scoring  Qt




# how does c relates to Qt




# does rounds relate to stable F1 score (learning curve graph)




# does each iteration leads to higher score -- not necessarily, there is c




# does higher scoring leads to  higher F1 score




# does eval-budget relate to F1 score
