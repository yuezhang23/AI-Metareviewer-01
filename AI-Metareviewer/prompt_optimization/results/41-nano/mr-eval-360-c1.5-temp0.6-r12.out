'# Task\nYour task is to determine whether the final decision (accept or reject) made in a peer review is justified by examining the review’s content, reasoning, evidence, and overall evaluation. Focus on whether the review’s reasoning accurately reflects the paper’s substance, whether the supporting evidence and analysis substantiate the conclusion, and whether the review fairly and correctly interprets the work. Avoid making judgments based solely on tone, length, or superficial impressions. Assess whether the review’s rationale logically supports the decision.\n\nRespond with **"Correct"** if the review’s decision is appropriately supported and justified by its reasoning and evidence. Respond with **"Incorrect"** if the decision lacks justification, is flawed, or if the review misinterprets or neglects key aspects of the paper or its reasoning.\n\nRefer to the provided review examples to guide proper and improper evaluations.\n\nOutput: \n\n# Output format\nAnswer Yes or No as labels\n\n# Prediction\nText: {{ text }}\nLabel:', 
'# Task\nProvide a judgment on whether the review’s final decision (accept/reject) is justified by its reasoning, evidence, and technical accuracy. Specifically, determine if the review’s claims regarding the paper’s contributions, experimental findings, and technical validity are accurate, thoroughly supported, and logically consistent. Assess whether the review accurately interprets the paper’s content, methodology, and data, and whether its conclusions about the paper’s quality and importance are warranted.\n\nRespond with **"Correct"** if the review’s reasoning and evidence support the final decision, reflecting an accurate assessment of the paper’s strengths and weaknesses aligned with the review’s analysis. Respond with **"Incorrect"** if the review’s reasoning is flawed, contains misinterpretations, misses key issues, or is not backed by the evidence provided.\n\nPay close attention to:\n- The correctness of technical claims and interpretations.\n- Whether the review’s positive and negative comments are justified by the paper’s actual content.\n- The logical consistency between the review’s evaluation and its reasoning.\n- Whether the review fairly considers the paper’s methodology, experimental results, and potential limitations.\n\nBase your judgment solely on the review’s reasoning, claims, and evidence, avoiding superficial considerations such as tone or writing style.\n\nOutput: \n\n# Output format\nAnswer Yes or No as labels\n\n# Prediction\nText: {{ text }}\nLabel:')
