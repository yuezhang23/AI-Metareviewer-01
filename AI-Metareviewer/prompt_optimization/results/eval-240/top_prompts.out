'# Task\n"Based on the provided review text, determine whether the review contains a positive recommendation for acceptance (Label: Yes) or a negative recommendation for rejection (Label: No). Evaluate the review using the following guiding principles:\n\n1. **Overall Assessment**: Consider if the review ultimately leans towards a positive or negative evaluation of the paper. This includes looking at the final rating and overall sentiment expressed throughout the review.\n  \n2. **Balance of Strengths and Weaknesses**: Assess whether the strengths of the paper are emphasized over the weaknesses. A recommendation for acceptance typically indicates that the positives outweigh the negatives.\n\n3. **Clarity of Recommendation**: Look for explicit language indicating acceptance or rejection, such as \'accept,\' \'reject,\' \'marginally above the threshold,\' or \'marginally below the threshold.\'\n\n4. **Significance of Contributions**: Evaluate the perceived impact and novelty of the contributions discussed in the review. Strong contributions that are recognized positively can lead to a recommendation for acceptance.\n\n5. **Limitations Discussion**: Consider how limitations are discussed. Acknowledging limitations is important, but if the review presents them as manageable or not significantly impactful, this can favor a positive recommendation.\n\nUse these principles to make a decision on the overall recommendation of the paper, focusing on the sentiment and clarity of the review." \n\n# Output format\nAnswer Yes or No as labels\n\n# Prediction\nText: {{ text }}\nLabel:',
