***** Image Program ******** valid script commands  ***1. run script file     requirements: script file that contains "script" in its filename     command-line: filename     example: "-name-of-script.txt"2. run load command     command-line:  load command + valid file path of a PPM image + imageID;     example:              "loadPPM res/mock.ppm mock"              "loadPNG res/mock.png mock"              "loadJPG res/mock.jpeg mock"3. run save command     command-line:  save command + valid file path to store the new image + destination image model ID;     example:              "savePPM res/mock.ppm mock"              "savePNG res/mock.png mock"              "saveJPG res/mock.jpeg mock"4. run transformation command     command-line:  strategy command + related arguments ...... + source model ID + destination model ID;     conditions : related arguments should enter in order and should be valid by command rules     example:              "brighten -100 fl fl-dark"              "brighten 100 fl fl-bright"              "luma-component fl fl-luma"              "value-component fl fl-val"              "intensity-component fl fl-intense"              "red-component fl fl-red"              "green-component fl fl-green"              "blue-component fl fl-blue"5. run filter command     command-line:  strategy command + related arguments ...... + source model ID + destination model ID;     conditions :              related arguments should enter in order and should be valid by command rules;              filter can use user-input kernel matrix, arguments are followed by kernel size and all              values in the matrix start from left-up most position, left to right, row after row.              sharpen\blur use fixed matrix with custom values. user still need to input size value              in the commandline.     example:              "filter 3 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 fl fl-s"              "sharpen 5 fl fl-s"              "blur 3 fl fl-b"6. run color transform command     command-line:  strategy command + related arguments ...... + source model ID + destination model ID;     conditions :              related arguments should enter in order and should be valid by command rules;              all commands use fixed matrix with size 3x3.              use need to input size value in the commandline.     example:              "sepia 3 fl fl-se"              "greyscale-red 3 fl fl-red"              "greyscale-green 3 fl fl-green"              "greyscale-blue 3 fl fl-blue"              "greyscale-luma 3 lou lou-luma"              "greyscale-intensity 3 lou lou-intense"7. run quit     command-line: "quit"
