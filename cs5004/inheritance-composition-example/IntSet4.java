 * Another way to fix the problems with {@link InstrumentedIntSet1} and {@link
 * InstrumentedIntSet2} is to make sure that any methods called by other
 * methods of the class are final, which prevents subclasses from messing
 * with them. The easy way to do this is to make this whole class final,
 * which makes inheritance not a concern. Unless we design our class for
 * extension and document how to extend it, making the class final is the
 * right thing to do. It may inconvenience someone who wants to extend our
 * class, but they can always use delegation.
