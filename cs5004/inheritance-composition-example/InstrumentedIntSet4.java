/**
 * In this case, the author of {@link IntSet4} decided to avoid the
 * inheritance problem by making {@code IntSet4} final. That means we cannot
 * extend it, so instead we use the delegate pattern. The idea is that
 * instead of extending {@code IntSet4}, we keep one in a field. Then we can
 * implement our {@link InstrumentedIntSet} by delegating method calls to the
 * delegate (that is, letting the delegate do the work), and we can extend
 * the functionality by doing other things in our wrapper methods besides
 * delegating (such as updating the count).
 *
 * <p>One disadvantage of this approach is that we now have to write a shim
 * for every method, even if all it does is delegate, whereas inheritance
 * would have included all the non-overridden methods for us. An advantage is
 * the increase in flexibility, since we can now do things such as instrument
 * an existing {@link IntSet} without having to know its implementation.
 * Since the delegate is a field, we could also do things like change it at
 * will. (This class doesn't support that at this point, but it wouldn't be
 * difficult to add.)
